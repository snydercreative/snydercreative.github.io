## Current Sites (past year)

### 100% me
The following sites are 100% me, from planning and design to implementation. 

#### [UOPlanner](http://uoplanner.com)
* UOPlanner is a character planning website for the game Ultima Online. This is a MEAN application. All code is public.

#### [SittingOutside](https://sittingoutside.com) 
* SittingOutside is a restaurant index for only places you can sit outside. This is an Node/Express site using Angular on the front-end. Code is private, but I'm happy to share in person, or temporarily grant access to a repo if requested.

### Other works (past year)
You can see my contributions to the [Baltimore County](http://baltimorecountymd.gov) websites starting on my [Baltimore County Github account page](https://github.com/mxsnyder), but here are the public repos I've been focused on over the last year:

* [Baltimore County website](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/baltimorecountymd.gov-assets)
* [Upcoming BCPL website](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/BCPL-assets)
* [Selenium tests for a few features](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/baltimorecountymd.gov-selenium-tests)
* [Power of Age Expo](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/PowerOfAge-Website)
* [Client-side boilerplate](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/boilerplate-client-side)
    
All server-side work is in private repos in Github and VSTS, and I'm happy to share in person. I cannot grant temporary access to these.
