## Current Sites (past year)

### 100% me
The following sites are 100% me, from planning and design to implementation. 

#### [UOPlanner](http://uoplanner.com)
* UOPlanner is a character planning website for the game Ultima Online. This is a MEAN application. All code is public, and I apologize in advance if you look at the naughty words data file. These are gamers, so I had to filter out a lot of NSFW language.

#### [SittingOutside](https://sittingoutside.com) 
* SittingOutside is a restaurant index for only places you can sit outside. This is an ASP.NET MVC site using Angular for the front end, and behind the scenes, all service requests are made to separate Node/Express API. Code is private, but I'm happy to share in person, or temporarily grant access to a repo if requested.

### Other works (past year)
You can see my contributions to the [Baltimore County](http://baltimorecountymd.gov) websites starting on my [Baltimore County Github account page](https://github.com/mxsnyder), but here are the public repos I've been focused on over the last year:

* [Baltimore County website](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/baltimorecountymd.gov-assets)
* [Upcoming BCPL website](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/BCPL-assets)
* [Selenium tests for a few features](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/baltimorecountymd.gov-selenium-tests)
* [Power of Age Expo](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/PowerOfAge-Website)
* [Client-side boilerplate](https://github.com/baltimorecounty/boilerplate-client-side)
    
All server-side work is in private repos in Github and VSTS, and I'm happy to share in person. I cannot grant temporary access to these.
